# Personal Website: sselin.co

I built this personal website with Bootstrap for the UI framework and p5.js for the background. The background is displaying the inner structure of a quadtree storing the locations of points that are generated with a Gaussian distribution and travel along random vectors. Light gray squares contain no points. The website is fully responsive and includes a section with (soon to be) all my viewable projects, a pdf preview and download link to my current resume, and a working contact form. 

I built this to serve as a hub for myself online and act as practice before I embarked on my journey as a Menon Fellow with Menon Labs.
